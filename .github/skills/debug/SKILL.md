  Systematic debugging with hypothesis-driven investigation. Use when something is broken,
  tests are failing, unexpected behavior occurs, or errors need investigation. Triggers on:
  "this is broken", "debug", "why is this failing", "unexpected error", "not working",
  "bug", "fix this issue", "investigate", "tests failing", "trace the error".
  Full access mode - can run commands, add logging, and fix issues.

# Debug Mode

Systematic bug investigation and resolution.

## Core Approach

> "Don't guess. Form hypotheses. Test them."

## The 4-Phase Process

### Phase 1: Assessment 🔍

**Goal**: Understand and reproduce

- What is the expected behavior?
- What is the actual behavior?
- Can you reliably reproduce?
- What changed recently?

**Key Questions**:

- When did this start happening?
- Does it happen consistently or intermittently?
- What are the exact inputs that trigger it?
- What error messages or symptoms appear?

### Phase 2: Investigation 🔬

**Goal**: Isolate and trace

- Trace execution from entry point
- Identify where expected diverges from actual
- Form hypotheses about root cause
- Test hypotheses systematically

**Techniques**:

- Add strategic logging/prints
- Use debugger breakpoints
- Simplify inputs to minimal reproduction
- Check boundary conditions

### Phase 3: Resolution 🔧

**Goal**: Fix minimally and verify

- Implement the smallest fix that addresses root cause
- Don't fix symptoms, fix the disease
- Add regression test
- Verify fix doesn't break other things

### Phase 4: Quality ✅

**Goal**: Prevent recurrence

- Add test covering the bug
- Document if the cause was non-obvious
- Consider if similar bugs exist elsewhere
- Clean up debug code

## Debugging Checklist

```markdown
- [ ] **Reproduced**: Can trigger bug consistently
- [ ] **Isolated**: Know which component is failing
- [ ] **Root Cause**: Understand WHY it fails
- [ ] **Fixed**: Minimal change addresses cause
- [ ] **Tested**: Regression test added
- [ ] **Clean**: Debug code removed
```

## Hypothesis Template

```markdown
**Hypothesis**: [What you think is wrong]
**Test**: [How you'll verify]
**Result**: [What happened]
**Conclusion**: [Confirmed/Rejected/Needs more info]
```

## Common Root Causes

| Symptom                    | Often Caused By                               |
| -------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| Works locally, fails in CI | Environment differences, missing deps         |
| Intermittent failure       | Race condition, timing, external dependency   |
| Wrong output               | Logic error, wrong variable, off-by-one       |
| Crash/exception            | Null/None access, type mismatch, missing data |
| Performance issue          | N+1 queries, missing index, memory leak       |

## Debug Report Format

```markdown
## Debug Report

### Bug Summary

- **Expected**: [what should happen]
- **Actual**: [what happens instead]
- **Severity**: [critical/high/medium/low]

### Reproduction

1. [Step to reproduce]
2. [Step to reproduce]
3. [Observe bug]

**Minimal reproduction**: [simplest case that triggers bug]

### Investigation

| Hypothesis | Test           | Result                     |
| ---------- | -------------- | -------------------------- |
| [theory]   | [what I tried] | ✅ Confirmed / ❌ Rejected |

### Root Cause

[What's actually wrong and why]

### Fix Applied

- **File**: `path/to/file.py`
- **Change**: [what was modified]
- **Why**: [how this fixes the root cause]

### Verification

- [ ] Bug no longer reproduces
- [ ] Existing tests pass
- [ ] Regression test added: `test_name`
- [ ] No debug code left behind

### Prevention

[How to prevent similar bugs in the future]
