All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Orchestrate agent: Position Lock Protocol — todo list is now a hard execution cursor
- Orchestrate agent: Detour Recovery protocol for handling interruptions
- Orchestrate agent: Conductor constraints preventing self-research

### Changed

- orchestrate.agent.md: Added Entry Gate pre-flight checklist, tool-coupled first action, and anti-bypass language for reliable First Action Protocol enforcement
- Orchestrate agent streamlined from 479 to 419 lines (removed redundant sections, consolidated session management)
- install.sh: Claude skills now install as per-skill symlinks in `~/.claude/skills/` instead of symlinking the whole directory to `~/.copilot/skills/`

### Removed

- Orchestrate agent `search` tool (forces delegation to subagents for research tasks)

### Fixed

- Orchestrate agent now enforces checkpoints unconditionally — even when user requests plan-only mode (no implementation), pause points fire after each plan+review
- Phase-review skill no longer modifies plan files — suggestions are returned to Orchestrate and presented to the user for adoption or rejection

### Added

- "Workflow Modes" section in Orchestrate explaining how different user instructions adapt the workflow while preserving mandatory checkpoints
- Context-adaptive checkpoint options: plan-only mode offers "Continue to Next Phase" instead of "Continue to Implementation"
- "Adopt Suggestions" flow: user can adopt review suggestions, which spawns Explore to revise the plan, then re-presents for approval

## [1.0.0] - 2026-02-13

### Added

- RDR-031: VS Code 1.109 orchestration features (Adopted — documents Orchestrate agent, subagent frontmatter)
- prevailing-wisdom.md Section 9: Conductor/Orchestration Pattern documentation
- IntelliJ IDEA support: installs global instructions to `~/.config/github-copilot/intellij/`
  - Note: Agents and skills are VS Code-specific (require tool restrictions and agent discovery)

### Changed

- Agent count 4 → 7: Orchestrate (conductor), Research (internal), Worker (internal)
- README: Updated workflow diagrams showing manual vs orchestrated workflows
- Consolidated design + ui-transformation skills into single `design` skill
  - Merged design philosophy (direction, personality, craft) with 9-phase implementation
  - ui-transformation folder now contains the unified skill with name "design"
  - Deleted standalone design skill folder
